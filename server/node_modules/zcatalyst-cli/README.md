This is the Catalyst Command Line Interface (CLI) Tool. They can be used to:

- Initialize your project and associate it with various components
- Create and manage your projects
- Interact with data in your Catalyst projects via console
- Deploy code and assets to your Catalyst projects

To get started with the Catalyst CLI, you can go through our documentation  [CLI documentation](https://www.zoho.com/catalyst/help/cli-command-reference.html).

## Installation

To install the Catalyst CLI, you first need to [Sign Up](https://accounts.zoho.com/) to ZOHO.

Then you need to install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://npmjs.org/).

---
**NOTE**

1. Installing Node.js should install npm as well.
2. The ZCatalyst-CLI is compatible only with node versionsÂ >=12.

---

Once npm is installed, you can get Catalyst CLI via following command:

```bash
npm install -g zcatalyst-cli
```

This will provide you with the globally accessible `catalyst` command.

---

**NOTE**

1. If you need to setup the cli in current directory alone use the same command without `-g` option.

2. Alternatively you can visit [CLI Installation Documentation](https://www.zoho.com/catalyst/help/installing-catalyst-cli.html) for installation instructions.
